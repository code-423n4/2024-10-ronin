[10/17/2024 04:35] tqkve
Apologize for your confusion, actually when select ERC-20 token option in C4 setup form, I didn't fully understand it as the description quite obscure for me. From our view, it simply mean the protocol interact with ERC-20 tokens.


[10/17/2024 04:36] satanic_angel_
Thanks for the clarity @kve , so would it be fair to assume that all weird-erc20 issues with the protocol (given that it's within the file-scope of the contest) will be judged and not considered as OOS?


[10/17/2024 04:39] tqkve
Weird ERC-20 issues are out of scope. If the two options are mutual exclusive, I'll try to add clarification or ask C4 to update on this. Katana V3 is permissioned, we review all tokens before adding them, at least for now.

[10/17/2024 05:30] samuselderg
I could be wrong but the way I tend to read the "general questions" section is informational to do with how the protocol might be used/deployed (not necessarily a scoping outline but rather just helpful context at a glance) and the erc20 behaviours in scope is more-so what I tend to expect as more of a rigid statement on scope

So in this instance, I'd expect that the protocol has exposure to ERC20 tokens, but not ERC721 etc, and that the ERC20 behaviours are out of scope

Again I'm not 100% on it all, just giving my personal view on how I've always read that section

[10/17/2024 05:45] satanic_angel_
Yeah that makes sense, at a first glance, it puzzled me as it‚Äôs not quite clear why would you have all erc20 without taking into consideration the weird issues that can happen but on a second-pass I was taking an assumption that erc20, which only gets approved by the team might be the reason why they are fine with having the weirdness list out of scope which thanks to @kve was confirmed

[10/17/2024 12:30] samuselderg (pinned)
Id assume you are on windows/wsl? I had the same issue, its because of the `:` in files in `/logs/storage` of both repos.

Only way i was able to get around it on windows was to fork the repos in github web interface and remove those files within github web interface then clone that instead

Otherwise if you use WSL + git cli within WSL you should be able to


[10/17/2024 12:38] pkabhi
is it soldeer or soldier?


[10/17/2024 12:48] samuselderg
I just read above sorry missed a few of you had this issue earlier too @s_wannabe @zhanmingjing @MSaptarshi 

@kve its a filesystem compatibility issue in that some files (in the `logs/` dir of each repo) have a `:` in them, windows users wont be able to pull the repos in without forking and merging the branch into `main` or using WSL (i think in theory) would be the other solution

Can someone from the dev team share some graph with the protocol flow or to mention here the  entry points of the protocol ?


[10/17/2024 15:15] doublevkay
it‚Äôs pretty similar to Uniswap V3, with some additional governance features and adjustments for Ronin. Therefore, it‚Äôs hard for us to completely ‚Äúre-document‚Äù the entire Uniswap V3 protocol. I recommend reading the Uniswap V3 white paper or its official documentation as an entry point.

Hello - what's the rationale for making pool functions permissioned? Is the idea to authorize only the operation contracts to interact with the pool?


[10/19/2024 01:58] doublevkay
Hi, there are some things I would like to talk about the **Governance feature**.

The governance features are primarily designed to support the initialization of liquidity in V2. This is intended to help prevent chaos from arbitrary swaps and mints when initializing pairs/pools. Additionally, these features open a use case where pools can only be interactable (for minting and swapping) once certain conditions are met - such as liquidity being available and any mistakes being checked.

Governance features have also been integrated into V3. It‚Äôs important to note that both V2 and V3 are built on top of the Uniswap foundation, which is expected to operate effectively without governance, ensuring that users do not incur losses even if the permissioned features are bypassed.

We also have a vision of removing the entire governance feature in the future to make Katana fully permissionless. 

These are parts of the reason behind the severity downgrading of the Governance contract.

> All vulnerabilities in the KatanaGovernance contract that do not affect user funds will have their severity downgraded by one level.

Hey, guys, wanted to ask can we consider bugs based on UniSwap v3 as known or to ask it in different way - can we consider UniSwap v3 related code is secure ?


[10/19/2024 15:47] doublevkay
Uniswap's known issues are out of scope (please see the audit scope). However, if bugs arise during integration or as a result of our changes to Uniswap, they should be valid. About the question, "Should we consider Uniswap v3 related code to be secure?" - we hope so, but we all know that there is nothing that can guarantee there are no security issues. Therefore, yes, any bugs that have an impact should be deemed valid. Ref from the contest details:
> All public known issues, including public audit reports of Uniswap V3 that affect Katana V3

checkout to the branch release and you'll be able to see them, if you can't see the branch then it means you didn't fork all the branches redoit properly


[10/20/2024 03:12] samuselderg
Sorry to be clear if you are trying to fork them instead of the WSL method, will need to do quite a bit via the GitHub web interface:
‚Ä¢ Fork each repo
‚Ä¢ Create a branch in each at the specific commit in scope for the audit
‚Ä¢ Remove the `/logs` folder in each repo (in the new branch that matches the audit commits)
‚Ä¢ Make a PR targeting `main` in each forked repo
‚Ä¢ Merge them in (so `main` is now the branch that matches the audit repo -- minus the logs folders)
‚Ä¢ Now you should be able to pull in the forked repos locally, but be careful not to change the branch after you do

You are correct, Katana V3 is a fork of Uniswap V3. We have a few changes but we don't want to underestimate  the importance of the such changes regarding security. That's why we need auditors look into it.

Katana pools are a lot like Uniswap V3 pools

A lot

Yes, there are some changes to account for the extra protocol state and centralization\. But also some unexpected ones

Let's dive in

In Katana, all pool initializations must go through the position manager

Let's see how it works

can someone suggest where I can up my Fuzzing with foundry knowledge, preferably YT???


[11/05/2024 15:05] ihtishamsudo
Fuzzing playlist of TrailofBits on YT


[11/05/2024 15:39] codexnature
Yea, thought about that, I was looking to focus on a framework I am already comfortable with Foundry and I don't know if Echidna is widely accepted?


[11/05/2024 15:40] ihtishamsudo
focus on learning fundamentals. switching from framework won't be difficult.
And echidna is widely accepted and being used


[11/05/2024 15:41] codexnature
Ok then. Thanks


[11/19/2024 06:22] 0xdanielc
Is the report out for this audit yet, I didn't find anything but want to learn from seeing what I missed üôÉ


[11/19/2024 14:37] enami_el
No net yet you can ask someone with backstage access to tell you the progress


[11/19/2024 19:59] 0xdanielc
Oh that makes sense, one guy I was talking to spoke of the audit results so he'll have backstage, I just need to get better to qualify for the backstage role lol
